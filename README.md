# How I Built a Stunning Portfolio in Minutes Using Vercel’s V0.dev

This portfolio project was built using Vercel's V0.dev — an AI-powered design-to-code platform that helped me rapidly generate clean, production-ready components. I was able to turn natural language prompts into React + TailwindCSS-based UIs in a matter of seconds, allowing me to focus more on logic, animations, and storytelling.

## Key Features
- Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS  
- Fully responsive and accessible  
- Animated intro screen with framer-motion  
- Clean UI with dynamic transitions and background effects  
- Sectioned layout for Work, About, and Contact  

## Experience with V0.dev
V0.dev was incredibly efficient. Every component I requested — from hero banners to navbars and contact forms — was generated in less than a minute and aligned with modern UI standards. The AI's ability to interpret design intentions and output functional, accessible code saved me hours of manual work and let me focus on enhancing interactivity and performance.
